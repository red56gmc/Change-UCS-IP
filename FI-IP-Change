#To change IP for fabric interconnects, login to either one via console:
scope fabric-interconnect a
set out-of-band ip <management IP for FI A> netmask <subnet mask> gw <default gateway>

#Repeat for the second fabric interconnect.
scope fabric-interconnect b
set out-of-band ip <management IP for FI B> netmask <subnet mask> gw <default gateway>

#To change the virtual IP used for system management, this should be in the same VLAN as the individual fabric interconnect IPs:
scope system
set virtual-ip <management IP for Cluster>

#Finally check to see that there are no errors, then actually commit if everything checks out:
commit-buffer verify-only
commit-buffer
